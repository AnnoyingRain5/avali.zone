# Avali.zone! The home of the avali.

This is the code repo for [avali.zone](https://avali.zone), the home of the Avali!

## Todo:

- Dynamically generate Avali Scratch resources page using the infra made for groups and content

- leaderboard for the Avali Scratch

- Content/group mini-sites (pages)
    - TLDR: allow group or content owners to control a sub-site
    - allow content editing, custom backgrounds (css?) and subpages of subpages

- Changing permissions on the website, not through scripts
